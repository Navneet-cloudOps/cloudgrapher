# Cloud Grapher
Cloud Grapher is a simple one page visualization tool for CloudFormation scripts.

Writing CloudFormation scripts can be a painstaking job and understanding
somebody else's script burns brain cells. Cloud grapher should reduce some of
the pain. Visualizing scripts is better for presentations as well.

Current features:
* basic editing using [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/)
* opening a script by dropping it on the editor or using the menu
* saving a script
* showing a graph generated with [cytoscape.js](http://js.cytoscape.org/)
* saving the graph
