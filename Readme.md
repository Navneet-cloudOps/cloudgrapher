Added two versions for editor, need to pick one

1. index.html is sort of abandoned, but it uses josdejong's JSON editor
2. index2.html is active, it uses jdorn's JSON editor which is backed
  by JSON Schema validation AND it uses Vis to show a graph

Both options allow to drag a file onto the editor without validating if
 it's going well at all. Option 2 allows saving template + graph
